                        Making balloon animals is a great skill to have for entertaining children. Whether you are a parent, magician, clown, or health care worker, you can delight the kids with your custom creations. Learn how to get started as a beginner, from the types of balloons you use to the basic techniques and step-by-step instructions for the balloon animals themselves.

                <p>Rather than just buy any type of long balloons, use high-quality twisting balloons such as are produced by reputable companies including Qualatex and Betallatex. You will have fewer problems with popping as these twisting balloons are thicker and designed to take the stress of multiple twists. Most of the standard sculptures are geared toward the use of size 260 balloons. There are also larger and smaller sizes, but a beginner should invest in packs of the 260 size.

                        You will also want to buy a good balloon pump to save your lungs. Look for a dual action hand pump. With this type of pump, air will be expelled both on the up and down stroke, inflating the balloon quicker. Once you have mastered balloon animals and want to do it frequently, a floor pump is a good investment.

                    Inflating the balloon:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                                Inflating a balloon to make balloon animals is far more than simply blowing them up. The most important thing is not to inflate the balloon too much. You need a good amount of uninflated balloon left to be able to finish your balloon sculpture and ensure the twists are not under too much pressure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Leave a 1-inch uninflated tip at the end of the balloon. This should provide enough leeway for twisting, as when making a basic balloon sword.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Balloon artists often release a bit of air from an inflated balloon by releasing the nozzle that’s held in their fingers before tying it off. This process is known as “burping” a balloon. It’s a valuable technique.

                    Basic twists:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                                The basic balloon twist is the foundation for everything that you make through the art of balloon animals. You hold the balloon in your non-dominant hand at one end. Then you grasp it farther along its length with your dominant hand and twist it. At this point, you must keep hold of the balloon to maintain the twist as it will otherwise untwist itself.
                            </li>
                        <li>
                                After the basic twist, the second fundamental skill in balloon twisting is the lock twist. The lock twist holds the balloon's segments in place securely and it is the basis for the head, ears, legs, and body of balloon animal sculptures. To make a lock twist, you make two basic twists along the length of the balloon so you have four balloon segments. Since you have to keep a grasp on the two twists, it's best to make them fairly close together. Then bend one end of the balloon against the other end of the balloon so it is bent between your second and third balloon segments. Grab the two middle segments and twist them together (three times at least) isolating them from the rest of the balloon. Now the twists should be locked and secure.
                            </li>
                        <li>
                                The fold twist (also called a loop twist) is a fundamental twist often used to make "ears" on animals and is the foundational twist in basic sword balloon animals. It is a lot like the lock twist, but your initial two twists are farther apart. You fold the longer middle segment in half so the two twists are aligned. Then you twist the at the two existing twists a few times. Now you have a loop segment.
                            </li>
                    </ul>

            <p>The dog balloon is a fundamental sculpture in the art of balloon twisting and the making of balloon animals. Many animals balloons such as the deer and giraffe balloon animal are variations on the dog balloon. And you will find that the basics that you master when twisting a dog balloon, will apply to more difficult balloon sculptures.</p>

            <p>To get started, you will need 260q-sized balloons. These balloons are 2 inches in diameter and about 60 inches long when fully inflated. These are the most popular size for making balloon characters, decorations, and hats.</p>
            
            <p>Making a balloon dog:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Inflate the balloon to about two inches from the end.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Twist three basic balloon twists. The first will be about two inches long. The second and third twists will be smaller, about 1 inch each.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            The first balloon twist (A) forms the snout of the dog. The second (B) and third (C) twists, will form the dog's ears.

                            Bring the first (A), longer twist against the main body of the balloon in preparation for a lock twist. You will be twisting B and C together while holding A and the main body of the balloon to create a lock twist.  Your balloon sculpture should now resemble the head of a dog.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Twist three basic balloon twists, each about three-inches. The first segment (A) will form the dog's neck. The second and third twists (B and C) will form the dog's front legs. As you did with the dog's head, create a lock twist by twisting B and C and holding the rest.  Your twisted balloon sculpture should now resemble the front of a dog with its head and front legs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Twist three basic balloon twists, each about three-inches. The first (A) will form the dog's body. The second and third twists (B and C) will form the dog's back legs. The final balloon segment (D) will form the dog's tail.

                            As you did with the dog's front legs create a lock twist by twisting segments B and C and holding the rest.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Keep in mind that there are simple variations on the dog that you can make:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Make the body extra-long and the legs short, and you'll create a Dachshund or wiener dog.
                            </li>

                        <li>
                            Make the sculpture out of a yellow balloon and create an extra-long neck, and you will have a giraffe.
                            </li>

                        <li>
                            Make the dog with a relatively short neck and long legs, and you can call it a horse.
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>There is no shame in just making dog balloons. There are lots of clowns and balloon artists who appear at kids' birthday parties and make nothing but swords and dogs. Kids will undoubtedly ask for more elaborate balloon animals that they have seen at other locales, but if time is of the essence just make dogs and swords.</p>
